# Libraries for Object Oriented Dart

Dart is a modern object oriented language; it's powerful and expressive. But,
there are a few areas where implementing a good object oriented design is harder
than it needs to be.

Libraries for Object Oriented Dart contains four powerful libraries that help
translate object oriented designs into implementations with minimum overhead,
freeing developers to focus on the task at hand.

* [enum_class.dart](https://github.com/google/enum_class.dart#enum-classes-for-dart)
  provides enums with the power of classes.
  
* [built_collection.dart](https://github.com/google/built_collection.dart#built-collections-for-dart)
  provides immutable, type safe collections.
  
* [built_value.dart](https://github.com/google/built_value.dart#built-values-for-dart)
  provides immutable "value types".
  
* [built_json.dart](https://github.com/google/built_json.dart#built-json-for-dart)
  provides dynamic, flexible serialization for the other three libraries.

And, to complete the package:

* Built JSON for Java will provide compatible serialization for Java,
  mapping Enum Classes to standard Java enums, Built Collections to
  [Immutable Collections](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ImmutableCollectionsExplained)
  and Built Values to [AutoValues](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value#autovalue).


  
# Current Status

* [enum_class.dart](https://github.com/google/enum_class.dart#enum-classes-for-dart)
  is alpha but relatively stable.
  
* [built_collection.dart](https://github.com/google/built_collection.dart#built-collections-for-dart)
  is stable and ready to use.
  
* [built_value.dart](https://github.com/google/built_value.dart#built-values-for-dart)
  is alpha and likely to change.
  
* [built_json.dart](https://github.com/google/built_json.dart#built-json-for-dart)
  is pre-alpha and will change.
  
* Built JSON for Java is not yet released.
